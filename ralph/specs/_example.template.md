# Example Feature Specification

## Overview

Replace this with your actual feature specification. Ralph reads files from this folder to understand what needs to be built.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1: Describe what must be true when complete
- [ ] Criterion 2: Be specific and testable

## Technical Requirements

- Requirement 1: Technologies, patterns, or constraints
- Requirement 2: Performance, security, or compatibility needs

## Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not included in this feature
- Future enhancements to consider later

## Examples

```
# Delete this section after reading

Good spec files:
- Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Include testable acceptance criteria
- List technical constraints
- Define boundaries clearly

Tips:
- One spec per feature/epic
- Keep specs focused (1-3 pages)
- Update specs as requirements evolve
```
